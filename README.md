# MARP Presentations (Obsidian Plugin)

The default presentation/slides feature in Obsidian lacks some configurability for me. 
For example: 

I can't even show 2 lines of text on a slide, since the second line will have a weired indentation. 
This forces me to use only lists on presentation slides, which is a little restrictive for me. 

Therefore I decided to bring over the MARP (Markdown Presentation Ecosystem) into Obsidian, since this looks like a very good fit! 

## For developers

This is basically a thin wrapper around the [marp-core](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core) npm package. 
If you want to contribute, please feel encouraged to submit a PR to [the plugin repo](https://github.com/bjesuiter/obsidian-marp-presentations/pulls)!
